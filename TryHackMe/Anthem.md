The scan gives the answer to 2nd and 3rd questions.
Port 80 is open which shoes that there is a webpage. Upon accessing it, domain is shown in the front. 

![Screenshot 2024-07-07 171237](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/5867b6a4-cac0-44eb-a2bc-c0f006bef302)

_Q. 4: What is a possible password in one of the pages web crawlers check for?_

Analyzing the nmap scan results, we came across a directory of `/robots.txt`

```console
| http-enum: 
|   /blog/: Blog
|   /rss/: RSS or Atom feed
|   /robots.txt: Robots file
|   /categories/viewcategory.aspx: MS Sharepoint
|_  /categories/allcategories.aspx: MS Sharepoint
```

Now Let's access the `robots.txt` from the browser `http://10.10.117.31/robots.txt` 

![1](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/d7c385e6-4c70-4ba2-a34e-b2dcf7b9e84e)


The directory shows the further directories and the `password` at the top i.e. `UmbracoIsTheBest!`

As we saw the `robots.txt`, the CMS used by the website is `umbraco`.

In the website, there are 2 blogs written by user Jane Doe. In second one, there was a poem written. I searched it on Google and came across a nursery rhyme. There, the name was visible that was of Admin.

![5](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/14b12582-88da-4d8a-b3ff-24e0d49ca58b)


In the other article, an email was given. Using its format and the name of the admin, I got to know the email address of admin.

![7](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/4307fa33-b6c5-4f99-b72c-cded73616bf4)

**Admin Email:** `SG@anthem.com`

### Spot the Flags:

I was able to get 3 of  the flags by analyzing the source code of the html pages.

_**Flag 1:**_ `THM{L0L_WH0_US3S_M3T4}`

![2](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/25af384b-8d8d-41df-9ff2-ed31ac1e49ed)

_**Flag2:**_ `THM{G!T_G00D}`

![4](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/eea5c484-8288-4160-aedd-05f54a5eb0c5)

_**Flag 4:**_ `THM{AN0TH3R_M3TA}`

![3](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/13940687-11e9-40fc-9df3-dd56d4bbe3f5)

Now to find the final flag, I opened the profile of the author of the blog. The flag was written on that page.

_**Flag 3:**_ `THM{L0L_WH0_D15}`

![6](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/cb1fb366-a0fa-4e72-8104-a4c4e72817cf)

### Final Stage:

Now let's get into the box using the information that I have collected. I accessed the windows with SG as user using rdesktop command. Then provided password found earlier.

```console
rdesktop $IP
```

**User:** SG
**Password:** UmbracoIsTheBest!

![9](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/08fa756a-845a-4ce5-bd69-7ab46ae7233f)

There is a `user.txt` present. Upon opening it we get the flag.

**User Flag:** `THM{N00T_NO0T}`

For admin password, I changed the view setting to display `hidden files/directories`, and it displayed the `backup folder` that contains `restore.txt` but it requires privelege access to open. So. I changed the security permissions and gave read & write access, and got the password.

![8](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/acc46e15-1224-4233-a598-927a85236bcc)

**Admin Password:** `ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime`

Now login into to windows using the admin password.

![10](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/614c03bb-563f-4041-b281-0e435ff072a6)

After escalating privileges, I got the `root.txt` file and retrieved the final flag.

![11](https://github.com/mishqatabid/WriteUps/assets/145700715/3a8a66c1-d0db-4da1-9912-f8381d6ee126)

**Root Flag:** `THM{Y0U_4R3_1337}`
